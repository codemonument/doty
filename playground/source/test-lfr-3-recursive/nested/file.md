# Nested File for LFR-3

This file is nested within the test-lfr-3-recursive directory structure.

**Purpose:**
- Demonstrates that LinkFilesRecursive recreates nested directory structures
- This file will be symlinked at `target/test-lfr-3-recursive/nested/file.md`
- The `nested/` directory will be created as a real directory, not a symlink
